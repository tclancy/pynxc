# Introduction #

Because PyNXC is a thin wrapper around the the NXC library, documentation for those projects will be very useful.  Of particular interest are
  1. The NXC Guide: http://bricxcc.sourceforge.net/nbc/nxcdoc/NXC_Guide.pdf
  1. The NXC Tutorial: http://bricxcc.sourceforge.net/nbc/nxcdoc/NXC_tutorial.pdf

All of the tutorial samples from the NXC tutorial are translated into PyNXC and can be found in the `tutorial_samples` folder.

# Simple program #
A simple program, out of the NXC Tutorial (Benedettelli, 2007) is the following program which moves forward until the touch-sensor (on NXT port 1) is pressed:

```
#include "NXCDefs.h" 
task main() 
{ 
  SetSensor(IN_1,SENSOR_TOUCH); 
  OnFwd(OUT_AC, 75); 
  until (SENSOR_1 == 1); 
  Off(OUT_AC); 
} 
```

The same code in PyNXC is:

```
def main():
    DefineSensors(TOUCH,None,None,None)
    OnFwd(OUT_AC, 75)
    while  SensorVal(1) != 1:
        pass
    Off(OUT_AC)
```

The structure of the program is a the same, but there are no `#include` directives, or semicolons.


# PyNXC Particulars #

## DefineSensors ##

The function `DefineSensors` is defined to easily set the various sensor values in an easy way.  The syntax for this function is

```
DefineSensors(PORT1,PORT2,PORT3,PORT4)
```
where the accepted values for the sensors in each port are `TOUCH`, `EYES`, `LIGHT`, `SOUND`, and `None`.


## Tasks, Inline, Subroutines ##

In every program there is a  function called `main` which gets called when the robot is told to run the program..  The NXT is a multitasking platform, where all of the initial tasks are started in the main program and are run concurrently.  In  NXC, tasks are denoted with a `task` keyword.  In PyNXC,

```
def task_foo():
    pass
```

is translated to NXC code:

```
task task_foo(){
}
```

In this way, the name of a function can determine what kind of NXC function is involved.  This convention works for functions declared as inline (e.g named `inline_foo`) and subroutines (e.g. named `sub_foo`).


## DEFINE ##

In NXC there is a pre-processor directive, `#DEFINE` which does a search-replace in the file before compilation.  Python doesn't have this, so I've added a keyword `DEFINE` which can be used like
```
DEFINE TURN_SPEED = 50
```

I think I want to change this in the future to be
```
DEFINE('TURN_SPEED','50')
```
to make it more clear that it is doing a string association.  A common mistake right now is:

```
DEFINE BAD = 10  # this comment gets inserted into code downstream
```

## Structs and Typedefs ##

NXC structs are implemented as Python classes, subclassing `Struct`.
```
class MyStruct(Struct):
    x=Byte(5)
    y=Word(6)
    s=String('hello')

m=MyStruct()

m2=MyStruct(x=6,y=7,s='this')
```

> Typedefs are implemented just like struct, by the Python subclassing syntax.
```
class MyByte(Byte):
    pass
```

## For-loops ##

For-loops work with limited forms range, not on lists (which donâ€™t exist in NXC) or arrays (yet).

```
i=Byte()
s=String()

for i in range(256):
    s=NumToStr(i)

for i in range(1,12):
    s=NumToStr(i)

for i in range(1,12,3):
    s=NumToStr(i)
```


## Multiple Task example ##

This program is a more complex example of a robot which has to wander around looking for bins to through a ping-pong into. It uses a [behavioral program paradigm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior_based_AI), and highlights many of the features of PyNXC:
